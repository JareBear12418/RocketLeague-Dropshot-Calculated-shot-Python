# RocketLeague-Dropshot-Calculated-shot-Python
Python version of [RocketLeague-Dropshot-Calculated-shot](https://github.com/JareBear12418/RocketLeague-Dropshot-Calculated-shot). This is just a tool I used to develop the actual [plugin](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/306). 

This can also be used for RLBot's aswell, while this spesific code isn't setup to be used in that regard, it just needs a bit of refactoring to work for that. You really just need to strip out the `opencv` code and you should be set. 

How to use this to simulate shots is commented in `main.py` so you have plenty of examples in there to play with it.
